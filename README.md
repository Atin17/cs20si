# CS20si Solutions

### What is this?
These are my solutions to Stanford's [CS20si: Tensorflow for Deep
Learning Research][1].

### What is covered in the assignments?
Assignment 1: Welcome to TensorFlow ([handout][1])

Assignment 2: Neural Style Transfer ([handout][2])

Assignment 3: Chatbot ([handout][3])

**Note:** For various reasons, I decided to implement assignment 3
from scratch and using PyTorch. As a result, my solution to
assignment 3 has been moved to its own repo.

### Acknowledgements
Thanks to Chip for putting this class together.
